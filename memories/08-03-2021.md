### The scope for today was: 

1. To set up a Kafka cluster with Zookeeper and all the things related to the kafka ecosystem.
2. Start learning Podman to learn a new containerization tool.

### Achievements

1. Kafka Cluster is up and running, in order to do so, just run the following command in the project root:
```
Make start-kafka
```

Once the Kafka environment is up and running you will have access to several urls, such as:

- [Kafka Topics UI](http://localhost:8000/#/)
- [Kafka Schema Registry UI](http://localhost:8001/#/)
- [Kafka Connect UI](http://localhost:8003/#/cluster/kafka-connect-1)
- [Zookeeper UI](http://localhost:8004)

The previously mentioned are the services that have a User Interface. For the Kafka connections, please check the docker-compose.yml file

2. I have been able to containerize a simple Golang App with a Hello world using Podman.
If you want to test it, under the root of the project run the following commands.

Build the image to be used by the container:
```
Make build-monday-go
```

Run the container by providing an image.
```
Make run-monday-go
```

### Personal notes

#### Podman:

Looks good, commands are very similar to Docker ones, it goes by the hand of another tool called buildah.
Perhaps will check more about [buildah](https://buildah.io/) in the future.

#### Kafka:
Really nice set up and good to have all the UI tools to ease it's configuration and monitoring. 
Looking forward to start using it in an app.
