# Monday 19th, April 2021

### The scope for today was: 

1. Learn Monitoring with Prometheus
2. Monitor the Golang App

### Achievements

1. To start the monitoring tool Prometheus, you need to run:  
```makefile
Make start-prometheus
```

2. To start the application to be monitored you need to run:
```makefile
Make run-monday-go-docker
```
3. Access to prometheus UI can be found in the following url:
   
    [Prometheus UI](http://localhost:9090)

4. Metric for health check counter added with following name:
```
mondays_app_http_health_counter
```
5. Added cAdvisor to visualize system metrics such as docker CPU and other docker metrics.


### Personal notes

#### Prometheus
1. I added a docker network soy prometheus service can communicate with the app.
2. Configuration to metrics can be done via code, will make your domain dependant of infrastructure.
3. In order to make prometheus libraries to work with Gin framework, the following snippet does the trick:
```go
func prometheusHandler() gin.HandlerFunc {
	h := promhttp.Handler()

	return func(c *gin.Context) {
		h.ServeHTTP(c.Writer, c.Request)
	}
}
```
4. When metrics can't be pulled from an exporter endpoint such as the `/metrics` endpoint, a push gateway can be set up.
5. To use a remote datastore 
   [Thanos](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos) or
   [cortex](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex) can be used, to be checked in another monitoring session.
6. Prometheus can be set up as an alerting system, alerting can also be set up in Grafana.
