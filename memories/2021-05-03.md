### The scope for today was: 
Setting up an API Gateway, for this time I have chosen to use Krakend.

If you want to use krakend you can spin it up by running:
```makefile
make start-krakend
```

If you want to see the logs from the api gateway which are an aggregation from the different services
then you can run:

```makefile
make logs-krakend
```

In order to configure Krakend you have several ways, either by writing yourself a krakend.json file
or by using [Krakend Designer](https://designer.krakend.io/).

This API Gateway let's you add different logging services such as Graylog or Logstash.


Once you have the API gateway running, if you call the http://api-gateway-ip:8081/api-gateway
endpoint it will automatically handle the requests defined in the krakend.json file and managing all your services.
